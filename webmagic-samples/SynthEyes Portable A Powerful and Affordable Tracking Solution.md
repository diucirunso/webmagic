SynthEyes Portable has many features that make it stand out from other tracking solutions. For example, it can handle complex shots with zooming, rolling-shutter, lens distortion, light solving, and multiple cameras. It also has a powerful image preprocessor that can improve low-contrast or noisy shots, or convert to and from 360Â° VR shots. Moreover, it can build textured 3-D meshes from images, which can be used for set reconstruction or object tracking. SynthEyes Portable also has a flexible workflow that allows you to combine automated and supervised tracking, use offset tracking or incremental solving, apply hard and soft path locking, and set distance or cross-camera constraints.
 
SynthEyes Portable is compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 or later. It can export to many popular applications such as After Effects, Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya, Nuke, Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and more. You can download SynthEyes Portable from the official website[^1^] or from SoundCloud[^2^]. The price is $499 for a single-user license or $399 for an educational license. You can also try SynthEyes Portable for free for 30 days before buying it.

SynthEyes Portable is a powerful and affordable tracking solution that can help you achieve amazing VFX results. Whether you are a beginner or a professional, you can benefit from using SynthEyes Portable for your next project.

In this article, we will show you some examples of how to use SynthEyes Portable for different VFX tasks. We will cover camera tracking, object tracking, geometry tracking, planar tracking, stabilization, and motion capture. We will also show you how to export your tracking data to other applications and how to use the SynthEyes Portable features to enhance your shots.
 
## Camera Tracking
 
Camera tracking is the process of estimating the position and orientation of a camera in a scene from a sequence of images. Camera tracking is essential for inserting 3-D elements into a shot or creating a virtual set. SynthEyes Portable can handle various types of camera shots, such as translating, rotating, zooming, nodal, stereoscopic, or 360Â° VR shots. It can also compensate for lens distortion and rolling-shutter effects.
 
To perform camera tracking with SynthEyes Portable, you need to import your image sequence and set the frame rate and the pixel aspect ratio. You can also adjust the image preprocessor settings to improve the quality of your images. Then, you can choose the type of camera shot from the menu and click the Auto button to start the automatic tracking process. SynthEyes Portable will analyze the images and create a 3-D point cloud that represents the features in the scene. You can inspect the point cloud and adjust the tracking parameters if needed. You can also add manual trackers or delete bad trackers to improve the accuracy of the solution.
 
Once you are satisfied with the point cloud, you can click the Solve button to calculate the camera motion. SynthEyes Portable will display a 3-D coordinate system and a camera path that show the position and orientation of the camera in the scene. You can check the quality of the solution by looking at the error values and the residuals graph. You can also play back the shot and see how well the point cloud matches the images.
 
The next step is to orient and scale the scene to match your 3-D environment. You can use various tools in SynthEyes Portable to do this, such as setting ground planes, origin points, axes directions, or distance constraints. You can also use survey data or fiducial tags to align your scene with real-world measurements.
 
Finally, you can export your camera data to your preferred 3-D application using one of the many formats supported by SynthEyes Portable. You can also export your point cloud as a mesh or a point cloud file for reference or set reconstruction.
 
## Object Tracking
 
Object tracking is the process of estimating the position and orientation of an object in a scene from a sequence of images. Object tracking is useful for replacing or enhancing an object in a shot or for creating realistic interactions between 3-D elements and real objects. SynthEyes Portable can track rigid or non-rigid objects with or without a reference mesh.
 
To perform object tracking with SynthEyes Portable, you need to import your image sequence and set the frame rate and the pixel aspect ratio. You can also adjust the image preprocessor settings to improve the quality of your images. Then, you need to import your reference mesh if you have one or create one from scratch using SynthEyes Portable's mesh tools. You can also use SynthEyes Portable's texture extraction feature to create a texture map for your mesh from the images.
 
Next, you need to align your mesh with your object in the first frame of your shot. You can use various tools in SynthEyes Portable to do this, such as scaling, rotating, translating, or deforming your mesh. You can also use manual trackers or feature points to help you align your mesh.
 
Once you have aligned your mesh with your object, you can click the Track button to start the object tracking process. SynthEyes Portable will analyze the images and create a 3-D point cloud that represents the features on your object. It will also move and deform your mesh to match your object in each frame. You can inspect the point cloud and adjust the tracking parameters if needed. You can also add manual trackers or delete bad trackers to improve the accuracy of the solution.
 
When you are satisfied with the object motion, you can export your object data to your preferred 3-D application using one of the many formats supported by SynthEyes Portable. You can also export your mesh and texture map for further editing or rendering.
